# State-Duma-Spring-2022
Analysis of the State Duma's work during a spring session: distribution of voices, rating of deputies, regions' comparison. Data was collected through API services of an official State Duma's web-site. However, it was presented in a specific and hardly readable format, so, firstly, I edited data by summarizing some of variables and joining it with additional table, containing information on deputies' names, ids and parties (also, initial data did not contain votes from a 15th July, so this part also was added in a process of preprocessing). Subsequently, I provided analysis in a few stages:

1) Count of total numbers

2) Dynamics of votings on a timeline

3) Distribution of votes by parties

4) Ratings of deputies by number of each type of votes (for, against, abstain, absent)

5) Distribution of votes by regions

6) Distinct deputies' votes groupped by a region

Results of analysis are visualized in Infogram (1, 2, 3), Tableau (4, 6), and DataWrapper (5)
